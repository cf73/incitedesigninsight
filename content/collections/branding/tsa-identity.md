        text: "When we get dressed in the morning, we usually think about what we will be doing that day, who we will be meeting, and what overall image we would like to portray.\_ A new look usually gives us a lift and puts a little more bounce in our step.\_ At Olcott, your national center, the staff has been looking for ways to give the Society a little more bounce in the way that it meets the public.\_ We have considered what image would best represent us to new seekers who might be attracted and want to become a part of us.\_"

        text: "Our explorations took us to the “designer shop.”\_ We didn’t want just any look; we wanted to have that special flair that bespeaks care and forethought to the overall appearance.\_ We were fortunate enough to have former national board member Tom Ockerse, also former head of the School of Design at Rhode Island School of Design, to offer us help in developing our visual image.\_ Tom, being a long-time member was familiar with the mission of the Society, but he was challenged with how one might get the idea across symbolically.\_ He explored different ways of writing the name, “the Theosophical Society in America”, a mouthful which alone is enough to scare off some timid souls.\_ As he worked with it, he discovered that parts of the name could be juxtaposed so that the O’s in Theosophy and Society could be placed over each other in such a way as to form a triangle.\_ Interestingly, when written in all caps, this arrangement actually makes the name easier to read. \_"

        text: "The triplicity of O’s brought about the idea to place their smaller reflection above them, seen as three dots.\_ Now there were two triangles, slight but present, with many implied meanings—as above so below, 3 objects, 3 fundamental propositions, etc.\_ And a bonus appeared in that this pattern of three dots was used by Master KH as a postscript incorporated into his signature, thus subtly evoking the energy of the early founders."

        text: "The official seal is still maintained on the new stationary design, but more as an official coat of arms than the primary focus.\_ It gives a feeling of being well established and also provides the clear link with our history and International Headquarters at Adyar."

        text: "To give an updated look, the body of a letter on the new stationary will have slightly more than a two-inch left-hand margin so that the edge of text falls directly in line with “in America.”\_ The right-hand margin will be ragged and only about a half inch wide in order to have adequate spacing for the body of the letter. This gives a fresh and modern look to our correspondence. \_"
