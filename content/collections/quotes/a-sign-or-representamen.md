title: Sign
quote: 'A sign (or representamen) is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It creates in the mind of someone person an equivalent sign… that stands for something, its object. It stands for that object … in reference to a sort of idea, which I have sometimes called the ground of the representation.'
