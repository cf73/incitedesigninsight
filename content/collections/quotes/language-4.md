title: Language
quote: 'From its syntactical perspective ‘language’ becomes any set of things related in accordance with two classes of rules: formation rules (which determine permissible independent combinations of members of the set, like a sentence), and transformation rules, which determine the sentences which can be obtained from other sentences.”'
