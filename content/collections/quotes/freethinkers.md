title: Mind
quote: 'Freethinkers are those who are willing to use their minds without prejudice and without fearing to understand things that clash with their own customs, privileges, or beliefs. This state of mind is not common but essential for right thinking; where it is absent, discussion is apt to become worse than useless.'
