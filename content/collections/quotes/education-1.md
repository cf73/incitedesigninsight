title: Education
quote: 'Contemporary Western education, with its tradition so firmly established since Aristotle, is a system based on comparison and competition. Its main interest is to multiply knowledge and facts and to develop intellectual skills and clever minds. That system perpetuates materialism and fragmentation as our worldview, which only proliferates the current state of our world.'
