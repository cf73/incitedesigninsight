title: Thinking
quote: 'A thought is a purpose in order to perform the reflection necessary to the straightening out the threads of thought. Laying them orderly and parallel will consist first of all in defining to our-selves what the purpose is to bring about and (for) what use and its designed to sub-serve. That is Pragmatism.'
