title: Language
quote: 'The term ‘language’, in common with most terms which have to do with signs, is ambiguous, since its characterization may be given in terms of the various dimensions. Thus, the formalist is inclined to consider any axiomatic system as a language, regardless of whether there are any things which it denotes, or whether the system is actually used by any group of interpreters.'
