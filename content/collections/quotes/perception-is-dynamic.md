title: Perception
quote: 'Perception is dynamic since any change in perception reflects natureâ€™s underlying law of CAUSE AND EFFECT. Remember also that any effect is always caused by some other effect, which was caused by another effect, and so on! Thus, our perception of expanding patterns of relationships!'
