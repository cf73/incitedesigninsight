title: Process
quote: 'There is no such a thing as a "designer." Whatever or whoever designs, gets designed in turn simultaneously. The ultimate value of the designer must be found in "not designing." Design should not be understood as "making," but "making appear." "That-which-appears-of-itself" may be the final meaning of Oullim.'
