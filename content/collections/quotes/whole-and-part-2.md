title: Wholeness
quote: 'However, the whole is NOT the sum of its parts. The putting together of parts does not create a psychological, living whole, although it may create a mechanical whole. The Whole has to be perceived first before the Parts can be brought together in a harmonious pattern. The process cannot be reversed. Without perceiving the Whole the problem of relationship cannot be effectively tackled.'
