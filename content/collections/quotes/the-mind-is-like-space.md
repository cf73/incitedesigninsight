title: Mind
quote: 'The mind is like space. There is room in it for everything or nothing. We always have a perspective once we know that space of the mind, its emptiness. Armies can come into the mind and leave, butterflies, rainclouds, or nothing. All things can come and go through without us being caught up in reaction or resistance.'
