title: Contemplation
quote: 'In the interest to develop our cleverness and competition we ignore how to pay attention and to think in accord with intention. Attention, or contemplative practice, is the gateway to consciousness. Attention nurtures insight. Even science is finally beginning to acknowledge that cognitive control and attention are essential to understanding.'
