title: Metalanguage
quote: 'Metalanguage helps bring about an equation according to some relative origin, basis, or reference. In fact, everything that we evoke to help us bring about a level of understanding in which knowledge is relatively confirmed by rules, laws, or simply relationships, constitutes what we generalize as the metalanguage.'
