title: Education
quote: 'In its Latin root meaning the word “education” means “to draw out.” Contrary to Aristotle, who considered the individual born “empty” into which knowledge must be “poured,” Plato understood education as a process that “draws out” what is already within. Plato’s perspective reflects a sense of wholeness, wherein the function of education helps to unfold one’s capacity to perceive the essential.'
