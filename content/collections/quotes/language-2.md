title: Language
quote: 'The empiricist is inclined to stress the necessity of the relation of signs to objects which they denote and whose properties they truly state; the pragmatist is inclined to regard a language as a type of communicative activity, social in origin and nature, by which members of a social group are able to meet more satisfactorily their individual and common needs.'
