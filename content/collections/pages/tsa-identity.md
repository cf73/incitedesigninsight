            text: "Frankly, Tom wanted to keep this simple in process—especially since the full name is so very long! Along with that he also studied the possible use of the original “emblem” for the international theosophical society with its parts, and especially the two inverted triangles, itself a powerful universal symbol (for its representation of the Higher and Lower aspects of nature and being part of that. But the name itself was important, so he started out “writing” out the name in typographic form to discover its parts to operate in a potential configured (vs. linear) structure.\_\_To that he began to add the triangular symbol for potential integration."

            text: 'Key in this configuration was the use of the “Golden Ration” proportion system. This system, based on the Greek letter Phi as a special number that approximately equals 1.618, is also known as the Golden Section, Golden Mean, Golden Rule, Divine Proportion. This proportion system is known in mathematics as the “Fibonacci sequence”—but significant in that it is naturally found as a reoccurring sequence of numbers found everywhere in nature, such as in the seashell, the leaves on a tree, human form, etc. Furthermore, the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two numbers before it: 0, 1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on, to infinity. The Greeks named this mathematical principle as the so-called “Golden Ratio”. In turn it has been used in design objects by cultures from around all the world. It’s proportional qualities is also withing us, as we sense this intuitively, but can be proven scientifically, as mathematicians have shown throughout the ages. Science tell us it’s embedded not only within each of us, but in all of nature, in the world we live in, and in all of the universe we are part of.'

            text: 'Designers have discovered this phenomenon as something to work with consciously and as a purposeful tool. However, much is to be said for working with this intuitively since we sense we are part of this “relational” (proportional) values in all form, the visual parts, and the invisible whole. Thus, it’s important to let the design evolve naturally, because if the designer intuitively feels like it’s the right fit, the right action, the right relational value, and right proportion—then it is part of this invisible cosmic quality we are part of. All this translates into such familiar words as harmony, beauty, and that which arouses our senses in aesthetics experiences; and that not only with beauty of “visual form” but also beauty referring to an essential quality arousing some type of reaction in the human observer such as pleasure, calm, elevation, delight.'

A new look usually gives us a lift and puts a little more bounce in our step. At Olcott, your national center, the staff has been looking for ways to give the Society a little more bounce in the way that it meets the public. We have considered what image would best represent us to new seekers who might be attracted and want to become a part of us.\_"

            text: "Tom, being a long-time member, was familiar with the mission of the Society, but he was challenged with how one might get the idea across symbolically. He explored different ways of writing the name, “the Theosophical Society in America”, a mouthful which alone is enough to scare off some timid souls. As he worked with it, he discovered that parts of the name could be juxtaposed so that the O’s in Theosophy and Society could be placed over each other in such a way as to form a triangle. Interestingly, when written in all caps, this arrangement actually makes the name easier to read.\_"

            text: 'The triplicity of O’s brought about the idea to place their smaller reflection above them, seen as three dots. Now there were two triangles, slight but present, with many implied meanings—as above so below, 3 objects, 3 fundamental propositions, etc. And a bonus appeared in that this pattern of three dots was used by Master KH as a postscript incorporated into his signature, thus subtly evoking the energy of the early founders.'

This gives a fresh and modern look to our correspondence."

Soon we will have a whole new wardrobe with a unified look that we hope will attract positive attention from interested seekers.'
