summary: 'Since the beginning of Tom’s career as a graphic designer, the design work for “corporate identity” became the primary endeavor. That work started during his first full-time professional position at the famous J. K. Fogleman Associates in Morristown, NJ (1965-67). Since then Tom has continued this interest for a variety of clients. This video shares some of these projects, from 1965 through recent times. (Note: Today the design work for “corporate identity” has become generalized under the heading of “branding” —an unfortunate term in its inability to capture the depth of this “identity” interest and making it superficial.)'
