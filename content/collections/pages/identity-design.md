            text: "Since the beginning of his career as a graphic designer, “corporate identity” design (generalized today as “branding”) was a major design activity. That interest began during his studies at Yale University (1963-65), in courses with Norman Ives, Paul Rand, and Alvin Eisenman, but was then particularly stimulated during his first job at J. K. Fogleman Associates in Morristown, NJ (1965-67).\_Jim Fogleman, following his long and illustrious career at CIBA and having pioneered CIBA’s corporate design standards, decided in 1965 to start his own design firm in his hometown of Morristown. His studio’s primary clients included various companies from the chemical industry (Ciba, Hoffman LaRoche, Interchem, Syntex), plus other corporations like the newly formed IPI (International Printing Ink) company.\_"

Fogleman in 1951 as design director of the U.S. Ciba subsidiary located in Summit, NJ. Known as a pioneer of corporate identity, he employed gifted designers and established Ciba’s reputation through a consistently applied modernist identity program (a nice contrast with the expressive, painterly materials done by James McMullan for Roche Laboratories in the mid 1960s)."

The Sidelights covers are worthy of their own future post but I was most interested in the diagrams and charts that appear within the publications.\_Most of the Sidelights issues profiled a particular department and began with a chart illustrating the hierarchy of workers. A more abstract version of the organizational chart appeared in C&G’s booklet for Xerox’s Dual Ladder program."

Geigy had been employing heavy hitters like Fred Troller, Armin Hofmann, George Giusti, and Steff Geissbuhler (who joined Chermayeff & Geismar’s studio in 1975). Fogleman went on to co-found the landmark design firm Unimark in 1965 with Massimo Vignelli, Ralph Eckerstrom, Wally Gutches, Larry Klein, Robert Moldafsky, and Bob Noorda."
