summary: |-
  This TOETICS segment for IDI presents a more detailed information source for the bookworks and other printed matter sold through Tom Ockerse Editions (TOE). TOE started in 1967 as an alternative publishing business to distribute avant-garde objects of art known as “bookworks” (which conventional publishers were then not interested in or not able to produce). Over time TOE has added new bookworks and related printed matter for purchase (visit the business website TOETICS.com (http://toetics.com).

  These bookworks and related printed matter were means to make art and poetry that were not limited to either gallery or publishing conventions. They reflected new directions for creative endeavors by considering the object itself as a significant contributor to the experience of content; i.e., the object as an integral system for poetry and art. These endeavors all entailed creative process, which is what TOETICS for IDI documents.
